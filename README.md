# GToken ERC20 Smart Contract
GToken is an ERC20 token smart contract that allows the owner to mint new tokens and allows anyone to burn tokens. It utilizes the OpenZeppelin ERC20 token contract library to ensure security and compatibility with existing ERC20 standards.

# Features
Minting: The owner of the smart contract has the exclusive ability to mint new tokens. This allows for controlled token supply management.

Burning: Any holder of GToken can burn their own tokens. This feature enables users to permanently remove tokens from circulation.

OpenZeppelin ERC20: The smart contract is built using the OpenZeppelin ERC20 token contract library. This ensures compliance with ERC20 standards and provides robust security mechanisms.

# Getting Started
To deploy and use the GToken ERC20 smart contract, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/GToken.git
Install the required dependencies: npm install
Customize the smart contract parameters, such as token name, symbol, and initial supply, in the GToken.sol file.
Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum network, such as Ganache or a public testnet. You can use tools like Truffle or Hardhat for deployment.
Interact with the deployed smart contract using your preferred Ethereum development framework or tools.
